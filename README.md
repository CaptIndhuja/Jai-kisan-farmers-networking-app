  Also End-consumers and entrepreneurs based on agriculture goods and services can get direct contact with farmers and promote their business and generate profit.
  
  Mission: Platform for farmers to be financially independent, generate profit and contribute directly to the Nation's GDP, instead of relying only on Middlemen and the demand-supply governing bodies.
